The organismal vulnerability to abiotic and biotic change is mediated by life history traits and spatial distributions. Here we performed a quantitative assessment of the link between reef coral traits and species extinction risk as reported by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). We used predictive models incorporating two morphological and two distributional traits alongside threat information derived from the IUCN Red List. Our model was derived from 585 reef coral species of known IUCN status. We used this model to predict the threat status of 77 data-deficient coral species and validated our model against data on Plio-Pleistocene fossil corals. Our model shows that 51% of the data-deficient species are threatened, increasing the estimated proportion of threatened corals. However, a mismatch (55%) occurred between our modelled extinction risk and observed extinctions during the Plio-Pleistocene, suggesting that the IUCN status for reef corals may not reflect true extinction risk.
